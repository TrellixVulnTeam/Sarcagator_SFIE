Wow! i didn't know that. thanks! 
I had expected better, so I'm mildly surprised to see you limbo gaily beneath the unspeakable basement standard set by your comrades in arms.
I am none too surprised to see that my point was totally and utterly lost on you.
True until proven otherwise eh?
Where did you here this? Some cheap detective novel or something? Once again, my sincerest apologies.
Other than showing your ability to bold your false or irrelevant claims what was accomplished here?
It just makes you sound as uneducated and immature as you apparently are.
You're lying to yourself... So I'll just keep letting you know until the cloud of delusion dissipates. 
Oh my goodness, yes! I had never thought of that. How silly of me.
This remark would be funny if you didn't actually mean it....
I see you know nothing about the subject...hardly a surprise.
Wow....there is a real person under there? Good luck on your recovery.
Don't worry, think everyone knows that your side doesn't have the sole monopoly on crazy.  
Really? Have you researched it at all?
Wow! i've never thought about it like that. you've given that a lot of thought 
I love how you managed to make a counter-troll sound like a serious reply :)
Oh dear, he already added to the gene pool. *rolls eyes* 
Gee, I'm just bowled over by your mature and articulate argument. *rolls eyes* 
I reply out of courtesy...But be amused all you want...It looks like you need it.
Hey that cheeseburger is on me, and make sure it has extra  rat poison!
