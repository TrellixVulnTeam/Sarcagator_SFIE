Wow, let's all clap for that great argument for _. Personally, i'm not sure why this is being brought up again.
Oh, so now you're claiming to be an expert on _ too?! Wow, you sure get aroud a lot!
I'm not big on the _ issue, but are you saying that anyone who disagrees with you is arrogant? Clearly you're the one who's arrogant, if you can make these kinds of baseless generalizations of your opponents. Isn't it you who always accuses opponents of being intolerant of people who think differently than them? Now that's irony!
Oh! Goody! At last someone who wants to actually discuss _!
Everyone is welcome to give their opinion on _ here - whether you're for or against (or does _ justify itself?) and please state the reasons as well. I would really appreciate it if you guys could include some extra informations regarding this issue.
So you are an expert in _?  The problem with letting people like you call the shots is that you really have no idea what you are talking about.
