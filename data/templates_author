Is your thinking really this simplistic? Either I have to agree with you or I am an _? Is that all the complexity you can handle? This or that? Black or white? 
I'm not a _ unless of course disagreeing or believing differently from you makes me one. If so then I wear the title with pride.
Good grief... A _?!.. My goodness how can you say such a thing?! I will have to ban you for even mentioning the concept of it, my dear old fellow!
Hey, I just have a question: you think I'm _? How would your mum have felt reading half the shit that comes out of your mouth? Fuck you darling. Oh and I love you.
