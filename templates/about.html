              Sarcagator is a program that generates sarcastic responses to <i>internet forum post</i> style inputs. It was created as a part of an Honours Project aiming to explore how we can employ Machine Learning techniques (such as classification) to make automatically generated sarcastic responses more relevant and evaluates the entertainment value in such Natural Language Generation programs. Feel free to try it with some of the examples below:

              Creationism is a joke dependent on an unproven god. Evolution literally happens. It's fact. Get over it.

              The idea of abortion as population control is absurd, especially forced abortions as someone mentioned a few posts ago. Anyone who has read a biology book knows the world has methods of population control on its own, we don't need to be doing stuff like that ourselves.This stat sounds more than a bit inflated. Seeing as it comes from a website called "women's issues" it is probably not all that credible.

              Capital punishment is hypocritical no matter what the state of the accused is determined.

              Still dumb to compare the two. Both are no good. Theft is better then murder...however a theif bragging because he didn't murder is a fool..Chris Rock actually did a funny skit on this.

              So the solutions to gun violence proposed by gun activists in this thread seem to be-1) More prison time. 2) More guns and have more shootouts between the bad guys and good guys. Yet, in other developed nations that have much lower rates of gun violence there are a lot less gun owners and people in prison. So are gun activists trying to sell people snake oil? "More than 5.6 million Americans are in prison or have served time there, according to a new report by the Justice Department released Sunday. That's 1 in 37 adults living in the United States, the highest incarceration level in the world.
